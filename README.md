# Motivation

Plants are great, especially indoor plants, which improve air quality inside the house and help reduce our stress levels. But it is often a tedious task to maintain and take care of them. Sometimes we forget to water them and sometimes we water them too much. Some prefer more humidity and some less. Tracking the amount of light, moisture, water, and temperature can be a guessing game. Following are few problems which motivated us to build an autonomous system to solve them:
1.	No one is present to take care of plants. It happens when we go for vacation.
2.	Different type of plants has different need such as different soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light. It is hard to keep track of each plant needs such as bamboo needs watering once in a week whereas tomato needs watering every 2-3 days. Also, it is hard to take other parameter such as temperature and light to account while watering them.
Our autonomous system - “Mintonomous” helps us do following:
1.	Monitor the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light and log the data.
2.	Irrigate the plant in most efficient way possible.
3.	Control supplemental artificial lighting.
4.	Less expensive. (<$100)
5.	Manual controlled by mobile or web application.
